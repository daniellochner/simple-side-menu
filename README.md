<p align="middle">"Simple Side-Menu" is a simple solution to adding sliding side menus into your Unity project which work extremely well for both mobile and desktop applications.</p>
<p align="middle">Try out the demo <a href="https://daniellochner.itch.io/unity3d-assets">here</a>.

## Features:
- Easy to use and highly customizable.
- Mouse (desktop) and touch (mobile) support.
- Ability to place the menu on the left, right, top or bottom of the screen.
- Control over when the menu is able to change state (based on the threshold drag speed and/or fraction), and how it changes state (by adjusting the transition speed as well as determining whether a handle, a button and/or the menu (itself) can be used to open/close the menu).
- Customizable overlay that fades in based on the side menuâ€™s state progress that can be used to close the menu when pressed.
- Assign methods to be invoked while a state is being selected, is selected, is being changed or has changed.
- ... and much more!

## Included:
- Two example projects (Clash of Clans and Google Maps).
- Ready-to-use prefabs (Left, Right, Top and Bottom Side-Menus).
- In-depth offline documentation.
